<h2>Inspiration</h2>
As an out-of-the box thinker, I have always been drawn to uncoventional innovations, particulaly those that are environmentally sustainable or that help improve the functionality of people's everday lives.  Over the years, I have spent countless hours researching for the perfect phone or the perfect portable silverware for my lunchbag.  I have also spent many hours with my mohter watching Henry Ford's Innovation Nation on CBS.  The ideas and products in this show have always interested and inspired me.  Most recently, my work in the Comratity coworking office space in Stamford, CT has intruducted me to a fun and functional work environment and facilitated my involvement in innovative events such as the Westport Maker Faire.  This site is community for all of the out-of-the-box thinkers out there to share information around the topic of innovation.

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
My project is currently in good working order, but there are definitley a few more things I would like to do in the future to really polish it up. Firstly, I would like to replace the logo text with a more personalized logo.
