<h2>Inspiration</h2>
As an out-of-the box thinker, I have always been drawn to uncoventional innovations, particulaly those that are environmentally sustainable or that help improve the functionality of people's everday lives.  Over the years, I have spent countless hours researching for the perfect phone or the perfect portable silverware for my lunch bag.  My mother also introduced me to the show Henry Ford's Innovation Nation on CBS.  The ideas and products in this show have always interested and inspired me.  Most recently, my work in the Comradity coworking office space in Stamford, CT has introduced me to a fun and functional work environment and facilitated my involvement in innovative events such as the Westport Maker Faire.  My hope is that this site will serve as a community for all of the out-of-the-box thinkers out there to share ideas and information around the topic of innovation.

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
My project is currently in good working order, but there are definitley a few more things I would like to do in the future to really polish it up. Firstly, I would like to replace the logo text with a more personalized logo. I tried to make my own .png, but I was having some difficulty placing it where I wanted in the navbar.  On my new and edit forms, I would also like to have a dropdown selection when the user chooses a category since my logic only allows for the user to type "Products", "News", "Events", or "Media" and the text is case sensitive.  In the new and edit forms, I would also like to prevent the text fields from turning white if you choose content from the built in dropdown that saves previous entries.  I would also like to refactor my code (especially my css files and my head.ejs partial) to clean things up a bit since my code repeats in certain places (I have a different head in my new and edit files with different css links) and is therefore not as DRY as I would like it to be. Additionally, I need to make the horizontal cards on my show pages more responsive with a vertical layout for mobile viewing.  A GA classmate also pointed out that all of my content is ironically contained in boxes, so it would be fun to have a button that says "Break Out of the Box!" somewhere at the top of the page (maybe in the navbar?) that the user could press to change all of the cards on the page to something more fun like circles or octagons.
